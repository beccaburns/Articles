# AUT Cycle Challenge - Listing & Creating Articles

### What does the code do?

This code was created to allow a user to view a list of articles, create new articles and delete articles.

### What gems, frameworks or tools does the code run on?

I created this code as part of a bootcamp exercise introduction to Ruby on Rails. I used Ruby version 6.0. I utilized Cucumber & Rspec for TDD and BDD. I also included shoulda-mathchers and Factory bot for testing.

### How can I use the code on my computer?

To access and run the code on your computer, you do the following;
In your terminal,
+ Open the correct folder where you would like to access the code
+ Git pull the repository to your local folder
+ Make sure you have all necessary gems and migrate frameworks to access the code functionality
+ Run 'rails server' to open the browser accessing the listed articles

In the browser,
+ You are now able to create new articles, review a list of existing articles, and delete articles from the list

### Acknowledgements

This code is still a work-in-progress. I would like to take time to acknowledge the support I received from the CraftAcademy coaches and colleagues. 

I also referenced the following [link](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

### Updates/Improvements plans 

I plan to continue to add controllers and corresponding testing frameworks that allow additional functionality within the site. This includes a login function for users.
